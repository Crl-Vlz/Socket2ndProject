## ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS

A simple player vs player app, where the server connects two clients.
Once both players select their choice the server sends a response of Win/Loss
to the clients.

The player will have access to a main menu that offers the next choices:
- Begin Game
- Check Statistics
- Delete Statistics
- Exit from app

**Begin Game** will start the game.

The statistics will be stored in a file server side that stores the results of matches. Giving a player a rundown of
matches played, who won the game and at what time it was played.
The stats will include the player's win percentage.

These stats can be deleted at any time bu the player when selecting the **Delete** option from the main menu.
